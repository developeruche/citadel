# Citadel
----------------
Citadel is a Polkadot parachain that aims to provide a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform for users to trade assets. Citadel is based on the Substrate framework using Hyperbridge as a Hyper-Secured-Messaging-Channel to bridge assets from source chains to Citadel where the exchanges happens. Citedal is built to model Osomis design where assets are bridged to the Osmosis App chain using IBC. The Swapping operation is then done on the app chain, after these operations are done, the assets are then bridged back to the source chain.
